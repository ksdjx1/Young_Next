## Props

### HTML Audio Tag Native Attributes

| Props       |  Type   |  Default  | Note                 |
| ----------- | ------- | --------- | ---------------------|
| src         | string  | ''        |                      |
| preload     | string  | 'auto'    |                      |
| autoPlay    | boolean | false     | Won't work on mobile |
| loop        | boolean | false     |                      |
| muted       | boolean | false     |                      |
| loop        | boolean | false     |                      |

More native attributes detail: [MDN Audio element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio)

The `controls` attribute defaults to `false` and should never be changed to `true` because this library is already providing UI.

## UI Overwrites

React H5 Audio Player provides built-in class names and SASS/LESS variables for developers to overwrite.

### SASS variables

```scss
$rhap_theme-color: #868686 !default;
$rhap_background-color: #fff !default;
$rhap_bar-color: #e4e4e4 !default;
$rhap_time-color: #333 !default;
$rhap_font-family: inherit !default;
```

For LESS variables, just replace `$` with `@`.

## Advanced Usage

### Access to the audio element

You can get direct access to the underlying audio element. First get a ref to ReactAudioPlayer:

```jsx
<ReactAudioPlayer ref={c => (this.player = c)} /> // Using `createRef` also works
```

Then you can access the audio element like this:

`this.player.audio`

## Release Notes

https://github.com/lhz516/react-h5-audio-player/releases

### Breaking changes from 1.x to 2.x

- Removed inline styles, import `css`, `scss` or `less` manually
- Removed props `hidePlayer` - Use parent logic to hide player
- Removed props `onDragStart`, `onDragMove`, `onDragEnd` - V2 isn't using drag events anymore

### Breaking changes from 0.x to 1.x

In 1.x, we use `prop-types` package instead of using it directly in React. Thus we dropped support under `react@15.5.0`. The usage will remain the same.
